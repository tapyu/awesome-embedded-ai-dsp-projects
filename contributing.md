## Rules adding a list item to the Awesome Embedded Systems for DSP and AI:

This list focuses **exclusively** on project tutorials for embedding system projects that use knowledge of DSP and AI to solve problems.

- The following characteristics are mandatory to have:
  - A project tutorial which embraces one (or more) of the following topics (or at least, something related to):
    - Digital Signal processing.
    - Digital Image processing.
    - Estimation and Detection.
    - System Identification.
    - Internet of Things.
    - Machine Learning and Neural Networks.
    - Numerical optimization.
    - Data science.
    - Computer Vision.
    - Sesoring and Monitoring.
    - Pattern Recognition.
    - Adaptive filters.
  - A consistent tutorial with clear step-by-step and source code.
  - A well-defined microtroller system used on the project.
  - Pictures, graphics, or a video with the project result.
- The following characteristics are optional, and depending on the project tutorial, may or may not have:
  - A PCB design of the conceived device with an EDA (Electronic Design Automation).
  - An Electronic circuit design.
  - A mechanical design.
  - The format of the tutorial, which can be in any format, such as (but not limited to):
    - Project from sites.
    - Youtube (or related) video.
    - A github-like repository, as long as it follows the mandatory topics.
    - An online course, as long as it is free (in the free-beer sense, but preferably also in the free-of-speech sense).
    - If your project came from an article or similar, consider making a repository in a tutorial format.

## Rules for making a PR of a list item
- Item fits in one of the categories, or you can start a new category.
- It is in line with the [awesome list guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/pull_request_template.md).
- Add new items at the bottom of the category (and ended with a period).
PS: For any other PR, fell free to make as you prefer
